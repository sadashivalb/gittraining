How to complain politely
Excuse me

Look at this small dialogue:
Jane: Excuse me, I think you are sitting on my chair
Anna: Oh, I am sorry.

Jane uses the words "excuse me" while she is complaining. 

Sorry

Although we are using the word sorry we don't always mean to appologise.

Look at the dialogue again:
Jane: Excuse me, I think you are sitting on my chair
Anna: I am sorry, but I don't think I am.

Anna disagrees with Jane. Although she uses the word "sorry", she says it is her chair, not Jane's.
