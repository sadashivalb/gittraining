Linux Network Administrators Guide
==================================
1. Introduction to Networking

TCP/IP LAN,WAN ,UUCP and IPX
Communication is impossible without some sort of language or code. In computer networks, these languages are 
collectively referred to as protocols.
The most common type of LAN hardware is known as Ethernet.

 Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) started out as a package of programs that transferred files over serial lines,
 ssh is more reliable then all tcp.
 packet - data will send as chunk  of data.
 
 2. Ies of TCP/IP Networking
 A subnet takes responsibility for delivering datagrams to a certain range of
 IP addresses
  Subnets are generated by the network owner (or the administrators).define the ip address range.
  
 IP has a companion protocol that we haven't talked about yet. This is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP),
 /etc/hosts. When adding or removing hosts, or reassigning addresses.
 
 3. Configuringthe NetworkingHardware
 
    eth0, eth1,These are the Ethernet card interfaces. They are used for most Ethernet cards, including many of the 
    parallel port Ethernet cards.
    Parallel Line IP (PLIP) is a cheap way to network when you want to connect only two machines.
    
    Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Serial Line IP (SLIP) are widely used protocols for carrying IP packets over a 
    serial link. 
 4. Configuring the Serial Hardware
 
    RS-232 is currently the most common standard for serial communications in the PC world. 
    The name stty probably means “set tty,” but the stty command can also be used to display a terminal's configuration.
    setserial - 
    
 5. Configuring TCP/IP Networking
    named is usually started at system boot time and runs until the machine goes down again
    dnswalk,
    /etc/hosts - configure hostname or FQDN
    gateway between the two networks, is assigned a host number of 1 on both of them, which gives it the IP addresses
    172.16.1.1 and 172.16.2.1, respectively.
    Interface Configuration for IP-ifconfig route
    route add 127.0.0.1Name Service and Resolver Configuration
       
    ifconfig lo,PLIP,SLIP simple point-to-point links like 
    netstat is a useful tool for checking your network configuration and activity
    The options –t, –u, –w, and –x show active TCP, UDP, RAW, or Unix socket connections.
    netsta -na -->a is flag
    arp -a
    
  6. Name Service and Resolver Configuration
     /ets/hosts - hostname
     /ete/reslove.conf - nameserver
     nslookup - nslookup is a network administration command-line tool available for many computer operating systems 
     for querying the Domain Name System (DNS).
     named is usually started at system boot time and runs until the machine goes down again
     dnswalk,nslint,dig nad host - useful tools
     
  7. Serial Line IP
     slattach - attach a network interface to a serial line
     dip means Dialup IP.
     dip provides an interpreter for a simple scripting language that can handle the modem for you,
     dip Running in Server Mode
     
     8. The Point-to-Point Protocol
     a kernel component that handles the low-level protocols (HDLC, IPCP, IPXCP, etc.) and the user space
     pppd daemon that handles the various higher-level protocols, such as PAP and CHAP.
     Similarly, /etc/ppp/ip-down can be used to undo any actions of ip-up after the PPP link has been taken down again
