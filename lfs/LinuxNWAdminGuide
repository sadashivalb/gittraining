Linux Network Administrators Guide
==================================
1. Introduction to Networking

TCP/IP LAN,WAN ,UUCP and IPX
Communication is impossible without some sort of language or code. In computer networks, these languages are 
collectively referred to as protocols.
The most common type of LAN hardware is known as Ethernet.

 Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) started out as a package of programs that transferred files over serial lines,
 ssh is more reliable then all tcp.
 packet - data will send as chunk  of data.
 
 2. Ies of TCP/IP Networking
 A subnet takes responsibility for delivering datagrams to a certain range of
 IP addresses
  Subnets are generated by the network owner (or the administrators).define the ip address range.
  
 IP has a companion protocol that we haven't talked about yet. This is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP),
 /etc/hosts. When adding or removing hosts, or reassigning addresses.
 
 3. Configuringthe NetworkingHardware
 
    eth0, eth1,These are the Ethernet card interfaces. They are used for most Ethernet cards, including many of the 
    parallel port Ethernet cards.
    Parallel Line IP (PLIP) is a cheap way to network when you want to connect only two machines.
