LFS
===
32 bit 4GB slow instllation file size less, exection slow
64 bit 8GB Fast instllation file size more, exection also fast

LFS and Standards
The structure of LFS follows Linux standards as closely as possible. The primary standards are:
• POSIX.1-2008.
• Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
• Linux Standard Base (LSB) Specificatio

Basics
tar creation,exrtaction,Makefile,make,make install
rpm -i pack.rpm
deb -i pack.deb
which cmd #find the path for cmd
locate cmd #Search the cmd in the system Locate command uses the database
created by updatedb.
./configure --prefix=#installation path default it will install in the /usr
If something goes wrong while running the configure script, review the config.log file.
LFS is usually installed on a dedicated partition
it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as swap space.
netstat -tupln|grep "ps name"
To create an ext3 file system on the LFS partition, run the following:
mke2fs -jv /dev/<xxx>
mkswap /dev/<yyy>
Replace <yyy> with the name of the swap partition.
grep #Search in the file
find #Find the content in the filesystem.
awk #Remove duplicate lines using awk.
vim +143 filename.txt #open the file and got to line no 143
vim -R /etc/passwd #Open file for read only
Set env variable
export env_name=value

The kernel is the heart of the operating system. In fact, it is often
mistakenly considered to be the operating system itself, but it is not. An
operating system provides provides many more services than a plain kernel.

The Linux kernel consists of several important parts: process management,
memory management, hardware device drivers, filesystem drivers, network
management,

========
Runlevel 0 is defined as ``system halt''
Runlevel 1 is defined as ``single user mode''
Runlevel 3 is defined as "multi user" because it is the runlevel
that the system boot into under normal day to day conditions
Runlevel 5 is typically the same as 3 except that a GUI gets started also
Runlevel 6 is defined as ``system reboot''

create swapping it will be helpful
The part of the hard disk that is used as virtual memory is called the swap space.
The kernel will write the contents of a currently unused block of memory to the hard disk so that the memory can be used 
for another purpose mkswap /extra-swap 1024
All the swap spaces that are used automatically with swapon -a can be removed from use with swapoff -a;

Boots And Shutdowns
booting name comes from an image of the computer pulling itself up from its bootstraps, but the act itself slightly 
more realistic.
During bootstrapping, the computer first loads a small piece of code called the bootstrap loader, which in turn loads
and starts the operating system. The bootstrap loader is usually stored in a fixed location on a hard disk or a floppy.

For PCs, the computer (its BIOS) reads in the first sector (called the boot sector) of a floppy or hard disk.
The bootstrap loader is contained within this sector.
After Linux has been loaded, it initializes the hardware and device drivers, and then runs init. init starts other 
processes to allow users to log in, and do things.
GRUB, the GRand Unifying Bootloader.
When booting from the hard disk, the code in the master boot record will examine the partition table (also in the master
boot record), identify the active partition (the partition that is marked to be bootable), read the boot sector from 
that partition, and then start the code in that boot sector.
Then the kernel will try to mount the root filesystem. 
After this, the kernel starts the program init (located in /sbin/init) in the background 
(this will always become process number 1).
/etc/lilo,/etc/grub
shutdow -h now
init
====

The kernel looks for init in a few locations that have been historically used for it, but the proper location for it 
(on a Linux system) is /sbin/init. If the kernel can't find init, it tries to run /bin/sh
After the system is properly up, init restarts getty for each terminal after a user has logged out 
(so that the next user can log in). init also adopts orphan processes:

system-config-users
useradd - adduser
user:x:123:345:/home:/bin/bash
123-userid 345 groupid x shadow link one user can have multiple group 
usermod - modify user
groupadd
groupusermod
chgrp grpname filename -- will change the group
chown user:group file - will change the user and group

chmod 750 file
7-user 5-groug 0-others
gpasswd -A bob projectx
