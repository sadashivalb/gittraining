LFS
===
32 bit 4GB slow instllation file size less, exection slow
64 bit 8GB Fast instllation file size more, exection also fast

LFS and Standards
The structure of LFS follows Linux standards as closely as possible. The primary standards are:
• POSIX.1-2008.
• Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
• Linux Standard Base (LSB) Specificatio

Basics
tar creation,exrtaction,Makefile,make,make install
rpm -i pack.rpm
deb -i pack.deb
which cmd #find the path for cmd
locate cmd #Search the cmd in the system Locate command uses the database
created by updatedb.
./configure --prefix=#installation path default it will install in the /usr
If something goes wrong while running the configure script, review the config.log file.
LFS is usually installed on a dedicated partition
it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as swap space.
netstat -tupln|grep "ps name"
To create an ext3 file system on the LFS partition, run the following:
mke2fs -jv /dev/<xxx>
mkswap /dev/<yyy>
Replace <yyy> with the name of the swap partition.
grep #Search in the file
find #Find the content in the filesystem.
awk #Remove duplicate lines using awk.
vim +143 filename.txt #open the file and got to line no 143
vim -R /etc/passwd #Open file for read only
Set env variable
export env_name=value
sort #
diff #
cat url-list.txt | xargs wget –c #Download all the URLs mentioned in the url-list.txt file
ls -lh #Display the file in the human redable form
gzip, bizp2, zip and unzip.
shutdown
crontab
service sshd status #Check the status of the service.
ps -efH | more #To view the current running process
top | top command displays the top processes in the system,O or O for up and down
Mount
=====
mkdir /u01
# mount /dev/sdb1 /u01
chmod #chmod +x file.txt
chown oracle:dba dbora.sh #oracle user and dba group
passwd #Set or change password
mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/ #Create the nested directory
ifconfig #Use ifconfig command to view or configure a network interface on the Linux system
ifconfig eth0 up/down #stop or start the eth0
uname -a #Dispaly kernal,host name
whereis bash #Find the where is bash
whatis ifconfig #Whatis command displays a single line description about a command.
man ls #Display the man page of a specific command.
head/tail buildout.cfg #See the top or bottom 10 lines
less hugefile.txt | ctr+f ctr+b
su - USERNAME #Swithc username
which bash #Finde the which bash
mysql -u root -p -h IP #To connect to a remote mysql database. This will prompt for a password.
yum install/update/remove httpd
rpm -i/u/e pkg.rpm #Install,update,remove or erase
ping -c 5 gmail.com #Ping a remote host by sending only 5 packets.
wget #web geturl or download
hkconfig httpd --level 2345 on
# chkconfig --list httpd
sudo su - zope
find . -name "*.sh" -print | xargs /bin/rm -f
ls *.xml | xargs -l -i cp {} /home/user
{} is the default argument list marker. You need to use {} this with various
command which take more than two arguments at a time
Opening port in a linux firewall

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 12345 --syn -j ACCEPT

iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 12345 -j ACCEPT

service iptables save

The kernel is the heart of the operating system. In fact, it is often
mistakenly considered to be the operating system itself, but it is not. An
operating system provides provides many more services than a plain kernel.

The Linux kernel consists of several important parts: process management,
memory management, hardware device drivers, filesystem drivers, network
management,

runlevel
========
Runlevel 0 is defined as ``system halt''
Runlevel 1 is defined as ``single user mode''
Runlevel 3 is defined as "multi user" because it is the runlevel
that the system boot into under normal day to day conditions
Runlevel 5 is typically the same as 3 except that a GUI gets started also
Runlevel 6 is defined as ``system reboot''

The /var contains data that is changed when the system is running normally.
The /proc filesystem contains a illusionary filesystem. It does not exist on a disk. Instead, the kernel creates it in memory.
/proc/1

    A directory with information about process number 1

Kernal Module
lsmod
