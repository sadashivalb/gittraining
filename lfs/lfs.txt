LFS and Standards
The structure of LFS follows Linux standards as closely as possible. The primary standards are:
• POSIX.1-2008.
• Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
• Linux Standard Base (LSB) Specificatio

Basics
tar creation,exrtaction,Makefile,make,make install
rpm -i pack.rpm
deb -i pack.deb
which cmd #find the path for cmd
locate cmd #Search the cmd in /usr
./configure --prefix=#installation path default it will install in the /usr
If something goes wrong while running the configure script, review the config.log file.
LFS is usually installed on a dedicated partition
it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as swap space.
netstat -tupln|grep "ps name"
To create an ext3 file system on the LFS partition, run the following:
mke2fs -jv /dev/<xxx>
mkswap /dev/<yyy>
Replace <yyy> with the name of the swap partition.
