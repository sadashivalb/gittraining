LFS
===
32 bit 4GB slow instllation file size less, exection slow
64 bit 8GB Fast instllation file size more compare to the 32 bit, exection also fast

LFS and Standards
The structure of LFS follows Linux standards as closely as possible. The primary standards are:
• POSIX.1-2008.
• Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
• Linux Standard Base (LSB) Specification

The system startup and shutdown is controlled by the system initialization configuration file /etc/inittab and the
init scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d/.Linux employs version numbers in its run-time shared object libraries[for any
software], which can therefore coexist on the system with different versions of the same libraries. for every
network change windows require the reboot,  Linux also has many kernel parameters which can be set through the
"/proc/" interface to allow dynamic changes to a running kernel. The file system directory structure is completely
configurable and not limited to drive letters such as A, C or D as a  top level mount point. Thus MS/Windows has a
limit of 23 mount points. (22 + Floppy). The kernel is at the heart of the Linux/Unix operating system. It is
responsible for enabling multi-tasking, multi-user, multi-threading, multi-processing, security, interfacing with
hardware and the network.

Basics
tar creation,exrtaction,Makefile,make,make install
rpm -i pack.rpm
deb -i pack.deb
which cmd #find the path for cmd
locate file #Search the file in the system Locate command uses the database created by updatedb.
./configure --prefix=#installation path default it will install in the /usr
If something goes wrong while running the configure script, review the config.log file.
LFS is usually installed on a dedicated partition
it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as swap space.
netstat -tupln|grep "ps name"
To create an ext3 file system on the LFS partition, run the following:
mke2fs -jv /dev/<xxx>
mkswap /dev/<yyy>
Replace <yyy> with the name of the swap partition.
grep #Search in the file
find #Find the content in the filesystem.
awk #Remove duplicate lines using awk.
vim +143 filename.txt #open the file and got to line no 143
vim -R /etc/passwd #Open file for read only
Set env variable
export env_name=value
sort #
diff #
cat url-list.txt | xargs wget –c #Download all the URLs mentioned in the url-list.txt file
ls -lh #Display the file in the human redable form
gzip, bizp2, zip and unzip.
shutdown
crontab
service sshd status #Check the status of the service.
ps -efH | more #To view the current running process
top | top command displays the top processes in the system,O or O for up and down

Mount
=====
mkdir /u01
# mount /dev/sdb1 /u01
chmod #chmod +x file.txt
chown oracle:dba dbora.sh #oracle user and dba group
passwd #Set or change password
mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/ #Create the nested directory
ifconfig #Use ifconfig command to view or configure a network interface on the Linux system
ifconfig eth0 up/down #stop or start the eth0
uname -a #Dispaly kernal,host name
whereis bash #Find the where is bash
whatis ifconfig #Whatis command displays a single line description about a command.
man ls #Display the man page of a specific command.
head/tail buildout.cfg #See the top or bottom 10 lines
less hugefile.txt | ctr+f ctr+b
su - USERNAME #Swithc username
which bash #Finde the which bash
mysql -u root -p -h IP #To connect to a remote mysql database. This will prompt for a password.
yum install/update/remove httpd
rpm -i/u/e pkg.rpm #Install,update,remove or erase
ping -c 5 gmail.com #Ping a remote host by sending only 5 packets.
wget #web geturl or download
chkconfig httpd --level 2345 on
chkconfig --list httpd #chkconfig Updates and queries runlevel information
sudo su - zope
find . -name "*.sh" -print | xargs /bin/rm -f
ls *.xml | xargs -l -i cp {} /home/user
{} is the default argument list marker. You need to use {} this with various
command which take more than two arguments at a time

The kernel is the heart of the operating system. In fact, it is often mistakenly considered to be the operating
system itself, but it is not. An operating system provides provides many more services than a plain kernel.

The Linux kernel consists of several important parts: process management,memory management, hardware device drivers,
filesystem drivers, network management,

runlevel
========
Runlevel 0 is defined as ``system halt''
Runlevel 1 is defined as ``single user mode''
Runlevel 3 is defined as "multi user" because it is the runlevel
that the system boot into under normal day to day conditions
Runlevel 5 is typically the same as 3 except that a GUI gets started also
Runlevel 6 is defined as ``system reboot''

The /var contains data that is changed when the system is running normally.
The /proc filesystem contains a illusionary filesystem. It does not exist on a disk. Instead, the kernel creates 
it in memory. 
/proc/1
    A directory with information about process number 1

create swapping it will be helpful
The part of the hard disk that is used as virtual memory is called the swap space.
The kernel will write the contents of a currently unused block of memory to the hard disk so that the memory can be
used for another purpose mkswap /extra-swap 1024
All the swap spaces that are used automatically with swapon -a can be removed from use with swapoff -a;

System-Monitoring
=================
System Resources -- top,iostat,ps,vmstat and lsof.
File system usage -- df, du -hs,
Monitoring the users - who,w

Boots And Shutdowns
booting name comes from an image of the computer pulling itself up from its bootstraps, but the act itself slightly 
more realistic.
During bootstrapping, the computer first loads a small piece of code called the bootstrap loader, which in turn loads
and starts the operating system. The bootstrap loader is usually stored in a fixed location on a hard disk or a
floppy.

For PCs, the computer (its BIOS) reads in the first sector (called the boot sector) of a floppy or hard disk.
The bootstrap loader is contained within this sector.
After Linux has been loaded, it initializes the hardware and device drivers, and then runs init. init starts other 
processes to allow users to log in, and do things.
GRUB, the GRand Unifying Bootloader.
When booting from the hard disk, the code in the master boot record will examine the partition table (also in the
master boot record), identify the active partition (the partition that is marked to be bootable), read the boot
sector from  that partition, and then start the code in that boot sector.
Then the kernel will try to mount the root filesystem. 
After this, the kernel starts the program init (located in /sbin/init) in the background 
(this will always become process number 1).
/etc/lilo,/etc/grub
shutdow -h now
init
====

The kernel looks for init in a few locations that have been historically used for it, but the proper location for it 
(on a Linux system) is /sbin/init. If the kernel can't find init, it tries to run /bin/sh
After the system is properly up, init restarts getty for each terminal after a user has logged out 
(so that the next user can log in). init also adopts orphan processes:

system-config-users
useradd - adduser
user:x:123:345:/home:/bin/bash
123-userid 345 groupid x shadow link one user can have multiple group 
usermod - modify user
groupadd
groupusermod
chgrp grpname filename -- will change the group
chown user:group file - will change the user and group

Paging is usually more efficient
but traditional Linux terminology talks about swapping anyway.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/halesh/ll - create swap file

swap space should be less than pysical memory.


getty listens at the terminal and waits for the user to notify that he is ready to login in (this usually means that
the user must type something).

Linux
=====
OS:It keeps track of files on the disk, starts programs and runs them concurrently, assigns memory and other
resources to various processes, receives packets from and sends packets to the network, and so on. The kernel
does very little by itself, but it provides tools with which all services can be built. It also prevents anyone from
accessing the hardware directly, forcing everyone to use the tools it provides. This way the kernel provides
some protection for users from each other. The tools provided by the kernel are used via system calls. 

At the lowest level, the kernel contains a hardware device driver for each kind of hardware it supports. Since
the world is full of different kinds of hardware, the number of hardware device drivers is large. There are
often many otherwise similar pieces of hardware that differ in how they are controlled by software. The
similarities make it possible to have general classes of drivers that support similar operations;

init is the main program starts when system started.
Networking is the act of connecting two or more computers so that they can communicate with each other.
/ - root directory
bin   cdrom  etc   initrd.img      lib         media  opt   root  sbin     srv  tmp  var      vmlinuz.old
boot  dev    home  initrd.img.old  lost+found  mnt    proc  run   selinux  sys  usr  vmlinuz
/bin - command execution for single user
/sbin - command execution for root login
/etc -- configuration file specific to machine
/lib - shared library needed by programs on the root file system
/lib/modules - Loadable kernal module(System recovery)
/dev - device files to help user interface
/tmp - programs running often store temprory files here
/boot - Files used by the bootstrap loader, e.g., LILO or GRUB. Kernel images are often kept here instead of
       in the root directory.
The /dev directory contains the special device files for all the devices. The device files are created during
installation, and later with the /dev/MAKEDEV script. 

/usr -  filesystem is often large, since all programs are installed there. All files in /usr usually come
from a Linux distribution; locally installed programs and other stuff goes below /usr/local. This makes it
possible to update the system from a new version of the distribution, or even a completely new distribution,
without having to install all programs again. 

like /bin and /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin

/usr/local
The place for locally installed software and other files. Distributions may not install anything in here.
It is reserved solely for the use of the local administrator. while upgrade of os changes will not affect.

The /var contains data that is changed when the system is running normally.

/proc filesystem contains a illusionary filesystem. It does not exist on a disk. Instead, the kernel creates
it in memory. It is used to provide information about the system (originally about processes, hence the name).

/proc/uptime,meminfo,net,cpuinfo
mknod /dev/ttyS0 c 4 64

hard disk /dev/hda
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) /dev/sda
floppy disk /dev/fd0
A CD−ROM drive uses an optically read, plastic coated disk
CD−ROM drives are slow compared to hard disks.
For installing new software, CD−ROMs are very good, since maximum speed is
not essential during installation.
A tape drive uses a tape, similar to cassettes used for music. 
Formatting is the process of writing marks on the magnetic media that are used to mark tracks and sectors.

A filesystem is the methods and data structures that an operating system uses to keep track of files on a disk or
partition; that is, the way the files are organized on the disk

fsck - check and repair a Linux filesystem
Logical Volume Management - make the drive to expand or compress if it's logical drive.
